  ever to create responsible citizens and informed decision-makers. AI is used
  to tackle many of society's fundamental problems; it concerns and will affect
  everyone.

  <strong>AIKreate</strong> was founded in 2022 to empower teenagers through
  learning AI by an experienced team of professionals in education, data
  science, and business management. Our educational platform enables them to
  make informed and ethical decisions regarding the adoption and use of AI in
  their personal and professional lives.
